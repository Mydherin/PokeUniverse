Instructions for AI agents working on PokeUniverse.

## Documentation

| Topic | File | Check when |
|---|---|---|
| Vision: purpose, game scope, art direction, non-functional requirements | [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) | Any feature, gameplay, art or scope decision |
| UI / UX: design, responsive, input, mobile keyboard, platforms, PWA | [docs/ui.md](docs/ui.md) | Any UI, screen, layout or interaction work |
| Maps: text format, tile catalog, tools, workflow | [docs/maps.md](docs/maps.md) | Any map creation, edit or map tooling work |
| Phases: MVP plan, scope and "done when" per phase | [docs/phases/](docs/phases/README.md) | Planning work, or starting/finishing a phase |
| Tech stack: structure, naming, languages, libraries, communication, auth, infrastructure, containers | [docs/tech-stack.md](docs/tech-stack.md) | Any technical decision or change |

- Check the relevant doc **before** making any decision or change.
- Follow what the docs say; don't introduce technologies or patterns that contradict them.

## Reference Repositories

Git submodules in `references/`, read only. Empty? Run `git submodule update --init`.

| Path | Repository | What's inside | Check when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `references/pokefirered/` | [pret/pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered) | FireRed decompilation (C). `src/`: game logic (movement, overworld, menus, battle). `data/maps/`, `data/layouts/`: maps, events, warps, connections. `data/tilesets/`, `graphics/`: art. `data/scripts/`, `data/text/`: events and dialogue. `src/data/`: species, trainers, wild encounters. `include/constants/`: IDs and flags | How a FireRed behavior, map, event or formula works |
| `references/pokemon-showdown/` | [smogon/pokemon-showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) | Battle engine (TypeScript). `sim/`: battle flow, actions, Pokémon state. `data/`: moves, abilities, items, species, learnsets, conditions. `data/mods/gen4/`: Gen 4 overrides | How a Gen 4 battle rule or edge case works |

Rules:

- **Read only.** Never modify, build or commit anything inside `references/`. Only update a submodule's pinned commit when the user asks.
- **Never copy code.** Understand the behavior, then write it from zero with our design ([tech-stack.md](docs/tech-stack.md#code-principles)).
- **Our docs win** when they disagree with a reference.
- Only exception: `tool-maps` reads `pokefirered` data as **input** for the map conversion ([maps.md](docs/maps.md)).

## Guidelines

### Living Documentation

Documentation must always reflect the current state of the project.

- **The user's requests are the source of truth.** Docs follow the user, not the other way around.
- **After every user request**, quickly check which docs the request affects and update **only those**, in the same iteration.
- **On conflict** (the request contradicts a doc):
  1. Point out the conflict briefly and ask the user to confirm.
  2. If confirmed, update the doc to match the new decision.
  3. Never silently ignore the request or leave the doc outdated.
- Keep docs **concise and consistent**: bullets, tables, short "Why" lines. Full coverage, minimal words.
- Don't create new docs unless the user asks.
